Big Nerd Ranch Guide project
This is the first app the book guides you through building. It takes the developer through the basics of app creation: the activity, views, xml, layouts, resources (such as strings and drawables), buttons, and toast.
The "model-view-controller" architecture is introduced, as well as the activity lifecycle and the interaction between lifecycle and device rotation. Further development included saving instance states, and passing data between activities through intents.
